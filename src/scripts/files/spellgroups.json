Familiars must breathe water or air and be either nocturnal or diurnal.  Familiars have telepathic communication with their masters, though they cannot speak or learn language, and will follow simple commands. At the following ranks they gain upgrades….\nRank 2: As a Swift Action caster loses all their senses but gains the senses of their familiar.  This ability is maintained with focus.\nRank: 4:  The familiar can now either have a swim speed of 15’, fly speed of 15’, or a land speed of 30’.\nRank: 6: The familiar can be teleported anywhere within LOS of the caster as a Swift Action. The familiar can also be used as a point of casting all spells.\nRank: 8: The familiar can now have two kinds of movement (outlined in Rank 4 upgrade).\nRank: 10: The familiar can now be of the Tiny or Medium size class as well.\nIf the familiar dies, the soul rushes back to its other half and with it comes the last minute of memories the familiar had.  The familiar’s form does not need to stay consistent across summonings but once summoned that form is considered permanent until they are reformed.  The familiar can be reformed at any time and will have the memories of all past familiar forms.\n",
